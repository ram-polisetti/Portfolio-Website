Over the years, I have honed my skills in leading data integration projects and enhancing operational efficiencies, delivering significant achievements across various industries.</p>
							<p> At JerseyStem, I have successfully led the development of an advanced automated data pipeline, utilizing tools like SQL, Python, and Alteryx to improve data collection and analysis. My role involved orchestrating real-time data integration and automation through Postman and Webhooks, which optimized data workflows and enhanced the organization’s agility. I also implemented a daily reporting system using AppSheet, Tableau, and Google Data Studio, which provided actionable insights and improved organizational accountability and project deliverables through superior data visualization.</p>
							<p> Previously, as a Transportation Specialist at Amazon, I leveraged Python and SQL to automate equipment scheduling and optimize routes, achieving substantial cost savings and operational efficiencies. I played a key role in designing and deploying an ETL framework with Amazon Glue, integrating multiple data sources to enhance data accuracy and streamline information flow. Additionally, I led a cross-functional team in utilizing complex SQL queries on Amazon Redshift, significantly improving system efficiency and reducing carrier fraud.</p>
							<p> I hold a Master’s degree in Data Science from the State University of New York at Buffalo, where I gained a comprehensive understanding of data warehousing, data modeling, and cloud computing. My technical toolkit includes programming languages such as Python, Java, Scala, and SQL, along with expertise in tools like Spark, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and AWS.</p>
