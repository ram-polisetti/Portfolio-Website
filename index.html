									</header>
									<!-- <span class="image main"><img src="images/pic11.jpg" alt="" /></span> -->

										<p>Hello! I’m Ram, a driven Data Scientist dedicated to transforming complex data into actionable insights that drive decision-making and innovation. With a Master’s degree in Data Science University at Buffalo - SUNY, I have honed my skills in statistical analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling.</p>
										<p>Over the past 2 years, I have worked with diverse teams in E-commerce, Supply Chain, Retail and HR, where I have leveraged data to solve real-world problems. My projects range from developing sophisticated algorithms that predict consumer behavior to implementing machine learning models that improve healthcare outcomes.</p>
										<p>I am proficient in Python, R, and SQL and am familiar with essential data science tools and libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. I’m also experienced in data visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI, which help me turn complex results into compelling stories.</p>
										<p>When I’m not crunching numbers, I’m exploring the latest in artificial intelligence, attending tech meetups, or blogging about data science trends to share my knowledge and learn from others in the community.</p>
										<p>I am excited to bring my expertise in data science to a dynamic team that values innovation and collaboration. Let’s connect and discuss how we can work together to drive your business forward!</p>

										<h2>Data Analyst</h2> JerseyStem, New Jersey (Mar 2024 - Present)

									<!-- <p>
										As a seasoned professional, I’ve orchestrated network monitoring and data analysis, leveraging Amazon Redshift and advanced SQL queries. This streamlined operations, resulting in a remarkable 40% improvement in efficiency and a significant reduction in carrier fraud. My leadership extended to a 5-member logistics data analysis team, where I implemented Python and SQL for automated scheduling and route optimization. This initiative led to a remarkable 35% surge in network efficiency across North America. Additionally, I collaborated on developing an ETL framework that consolidated diverse data sources, enhancing accuracy by 40% and significantly streamlining analytics processes. My commitment to excellence earned me the Amazon Leadership Principle Award, and I’ve consistently trained new employees each season.
									</p>

									<p> In my role, I conducted advanced time-series analysis to optimize transportation equipment, resulting in a 15% decrease in operational incidents during critical holiday seasons. Furthermore, I executed root cause analyses on supply chain disruptions using statistical modeling, delivering actionable insights that reduced supply chain incidents by 15%. Beyond technical expertise, I spearheaded a cross-departmental initiative, harnessing big data analytics to enhance predictive modeling capabilities. This effort significantly improved shipment forecast accuracy by 25%.</p> -->
